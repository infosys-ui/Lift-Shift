If you are a T-Mobile customer, you are also bound by the <span class="text-underline">T-Mobile Terms and Conditions and any other terms that apply to your plan or service</span>. If any provision of these Terms of Use conflicts with any term in the Terms &amp; Conditions, the Terms &amp; Conditions apply. If you are a T-Mobile service provider, dealer, agency, contractor, or an employee of any of these entities, your use of the Site may also be subject to your binding agreement with T-Mobile, and if any provision of these Terms of Use conflicts with any term in your agreement with T-Mobile, the term of your agreement with T-Mobile applies.</p>

    <p class="mb20"><span class="text-bold">Claims of Copyright Infringement/DMCA Notices.</span> T-Mobile respects the Intellectual Property Rights of others and is committed to complying with U.S. Copyright laws. Our policy is to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (&#147;DMCA&#148;). The DMCA provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed on the Internet.
    If you believe that material available on the Site or residing on our system or network infringes a copyright of yours or a third party for whom you are authorized to act, please notify our Designated Agent by using the procedures described in the DMCA and below. After receiving notice, we may remove or disable access to any infringing material as provided for in the DMCA. Our Designated Agent under the DMCA is Christina Kirkpatrick, 12920 SE 38th Street, Bellevue, WA 98006, 425-378-4000, <a href="mailto:copyrightagent@t-mobile.com">copyrightagent@t-mobile.com</a>.
    <br>
    The notice must include the information as provided by the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512(c) (3):
    <ol>
      <li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
      <li> Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>
      <li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit T-Mobile to locate the material;</li>
      <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit T-Mobile to contact the complaining party, such as address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;</li>
      <li> A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
      <li> A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="mb20">If you believe that material you have placed on T-Mobile&#146;s system or network has been removed by mistake or as the result of an improper take down notice, you may send our Designated Agent, identified above, a &#147;counter notification&#148; containing the following information as provided by the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. &sect; 512(g)(3):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your physical or electronic signature;</li>
      <li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>
      <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</li>
      <li>Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which T-Mobile may be found, and you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification that led to the mistaken removal of your material or an agent of such person.</li>
    </ol>
    There are substantial penalties for sending false notices. It is T-Mobile&#146;s policy, in appropriate circumstances and in its sole judgment, to suspend or terminate the Service of any subscriber, account holder, or user who is deemed to be a repeat or blatant infringer of copyrights.</p>
    <p class="mb20"><span class="text-bold">Promotional Codes.</span> From time to time, you may receive a promotional code provided by or on behalf of T-Mobile redeemable for certain promotions or offers ("Codes"). Such Codes have no cash value, are non-transferable and may have an expiration date, as well as other limitations and restrictions identified by a promotion. Codes may be found on or in product packaging, through Internet and other digital promotions, on brochures, notices (electronic, online, TV, radio), or other materials. A Code may only be entered once unless otherwise expressly permitted by T-Mobile. We are under no obligation to release, continue to release, honor, or maintain any Codes or maintain any services or features provided through Code redemption. T-Mobile reserves the right to limit, modify, or discontinue services and features accessed by Codes for any reason even after such service/feature has been redeemed, at our discretion and without prior notice to you.</p>

FURTHER, T-MOBILE DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT ACCESS TO THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, FREE FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY HACKERS OR DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS. T-MOBILE DOES NOT AUTHORIZE ANYONE TO MAKE A WARRANTY OF ANY KIND ON OUR BEHALF AND YOU MAY NOT RELY ON ANY SUCH STATEMENT OF WARRANTY. THE ONLY WARRANTY APPLICABLE TO THE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE ON THE SITE OR USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IS A WARRANTY PROVIDED BY THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURER(S), WHICH IS EITHER INCLUDED WITH THE PRODUCT ITSELF OR CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE MANUFACTURER(S).</p>

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF T-MOBILE (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SITE OR ANY SITE-RELATED MATERIALS OR SERVICES, EXCEED $5.00.</p>
    <p class="mb20">Certain state laws do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If these laws apply to you, some or all of the above disclaimers, exclusions, or limitations may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights. In such states, T-Mobile&#146;s liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
    <p class="mb20"><span class="text-bold">Indemnification.</span> You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless T-Mobile, and our officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers from and against any claims, causes of action, demands, losses, expenses, damages, penalties or other costs, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, brought by third parties as a result of: (i) your violation of these Terms of Use; (ii) your use of the Site; (iii) any Submissions you supply; or (iv) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>

    <p class="mb20"><span class="text-bold">Miscellaneous.</span> We may change these Terms of Use without advance notice. Please visit this page periodically to see the most current Terms of Use that govern your use. If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason under relevant law, then that part will be deemed replaced with a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect. T-Mobile&#146;s failure to enforce strict performance of any part of these Terms of Use does not waive any of our rights. T-Mobile may assign its rights and duties under these Terms of Use to any party at any time.</p>

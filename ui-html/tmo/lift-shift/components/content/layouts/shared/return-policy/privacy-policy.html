			<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt20">Location Data</h5>

			<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt10">Performance and Diagnostic Data</h5>

We may also provide you the ability to upload other information from your device to T-Mobile or third-party network servers. For instance, you may have the option to upload pictures, text messages, recordings, calendars, tasks, or notes.</p>
			<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt10">Collection of Information About Children</h5>

				<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt30 col-sm-10 pl0">HOW INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IS COLLECTED</h5>
				<div class="col-sm-2 mt30 text-right pr0">
					<span class="icon-up-top"></span><a href="#top">Top</a>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="mt10">T-Mobile collects information about you in three primary ways:</p>
			<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt10">Information You Provide</h5>
			<p>We collect information that you provide to us when you apply for, purchase, or use our products or services, or otherwise communicate with us.</p>
			<p>For example, some of the ways you may provide information to us include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When you sign up for our voice or data services or purchase other products or services, we may collect personal contact, billing, and credit information.</li>
				<li>When you establish or modify an online account, we may collect user identification information, passwords, and/or security question responses that you will use for future sign-on.</li>
				<li>When you interact with our customer service representatives, enter information on our websites, submit survey responses, or pay for services, we may also collect Personal Information and other information. We may monitor and record phone calls, e-mails, live chats, or other communications between you, your device, and our customer service representatives or other employees or representatives.</li>
				<li>When you use our services on a phone provided to you by an account holder.</li>
			</ul>
			<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt10">Information We Collect Automatically</h5>
			<p class="mb20">We automatically collect a variety of information associated with your use of your device (on our network, when roaming, or in WiFi mode) and our products and services, some of which may be associated with you or another user on your account.</p>
			<p>For example some of the ways we may automatically collect information include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Our systems capture details about the type and location of wireless device(s) you use, when the device is turned on, calls and text messages you send and receive (but we do not retain the content of those calls or messages after delivery), and other data services you use.</li>
				<li>We may also gather information about the performance of your device and our network. Some examples of the types of data collected include: the applications on the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, and other device or network performance issues.</li>
				<li><span class="text-bold">Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</span>We may use, or we may engage third-parties to use on our behalf, cookies (small data text files placed on your computer or device) or similar technologies to identify your computer or device and record your preferences and other data so that our websites can personalize your visit(s), see which areas and features of our websites are popular, and improve our websites and your experience.
					<p>We may also use web beacons (small graphic images on a web page or an HTML e-mail) to monitor interaction with our websites or e-mails. Web beacons are generally invisible because they are very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page or e-mail message.
					</p>
					<p>Depending upon your device or computer, you may be able to set your browser(s) to reject cookies or delete cookies, but that may result in the loss of some functionality on our websites. If we combine or link cookie or web beacon information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined or linked information as Personal Information under this Policy.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5 class="color-gray-dark">Web Browsing Activity</h5><em>Our Websites.</em> When accessing our websites, mobile websites and related applications and widgets designed for your device or web-based experience, we automatically collect certain information about your device and your visit, such as your IP address, browser type, date and time, the web page you visited before visiting our website, your activities and purchases on our websites, and other analytical information associated with the sites.
					<p><em>Other Websites.</em> When your device’s web browser utilizes our data services to access websites other than our own, we automatically capture information associated with your browsing activities, and measure and monitor network and Internet connection performance, throughput, latency, and similar network data.
					</p>
					<p><em>Do Not Track Policy.</em> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites (or the third party content on those sites) may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, we do not currently respond to the browser DNT signals when you use our services and products or interact with our websites or online services. We do allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services for online interest based advertising purposes and to opt out of our interest-based advertising on your device, as described <a href="">below</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li><h5 class="color-gray-dark">Voice Controlled Applications</h5>If you use a voice-controlled application, that application may collect and record your requests and other information from you and your phone.</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="text-bold">Information From Other Sources</span>
			<p>We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, we may receive credit information from third-party sources before initiating your service, or background information in connection with employment opportunities. We may also obtain updated address information from our shippers or other vendors. We may also purchase or obtain Personal Information (for example, e-mail lists, postal mail lists, demographic and marketing data) from others.</p>

					<span class="icon-up-top"></span><a href="#top">Top</a>
				</div>
			</div>            
			<p class="mt10">We use the information we collect for a variety of business purposes, such as:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>To route your calls or message or otherwise provide you with service;</li>
	
			  <li>To provide and bill for products and services you purchase and charge to your account;</li>
	
			  <li>To deliver and confirm products and services you obtain from us;</li>
	
			  <li>To verify your identity and maintain a record of your transactions and interactions with us;</li>
	
			  <li>To provide customer and technical services to you;</li>
	
			  <li>To create, modify, improve, enhance, remove or fix our network, products and services, and their performance;</li>
	
			  <li>To identify and suggest products or services that might interest you;</li>
	
			  <li>To make internal business decisions about current and future product and service offerings;</li>
	
			  <li>To provide you customized user experiences, including personalized product and service offerings;</li>
	
			  <li>To protect our rights, interests, safety and property and that of our customers, service providers and other third parties; and</li>
	
			  <li>To comply with law or as required for legal purposes.</li>
			</ul>
	
	
			 <span class="text-bold">Fraud Prevention</span>
	
			<p>We may use Personal Information, including voice print recordings, account information (such as purchase patterns) and device information for investigations or prevention of fraud or network abuse.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">Information Collected from Cookies</span>
	
			<p>We may also use information collected from cookies or other similar technologies to improve our websites, make recommendations, and complete transactions you request.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">Marketing</span>
	
			<p>We may use information we collect to contact you about T-Mobile or third-party products, services, and offers that we believe you may find of interest. We may contact you by telephone, postal mail, e-mail, or other methods. You may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us at any time as outlined below in <a href="#infochoices">Choices Regarding Use of Your Information</a>.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">Directories</span>
	
			<p>We do not publish directories of our customers’ wireless numbers; nor will we provide or make such numbers available to third-parties for listing in their public directories, without the customer’s prior consent.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">Performance, Diagnostics &amp; Management</span>
	
			<p>We collect information about devices, our network and WiFi usage to perform diagnostic analyses and understand how your device is performing overall. Diagnostic data helps us troubleshoot technical issues related to your device’s performance such as battery life, dropped calls, processing speed, device memory, service coverage, and network and WiFi signal strength that you and other customers may experience. If you are using a device in WiFi mode, we may collect information about that usage, such as the routing address and IP address. We also may use diagnostic data to identify and recommend products and services.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">Location-Based Services</span>
	
			<p>We use location information to route wireless communications and to provide 911 service, which allows emergency services to locate your general location. We may disclose, without your consent, the approximate location of a wireless device to a governmental entity or law enforcement authority when we are served with lawful process or reasonably believe there is an emergency involving risk of death or serious physical harm.</p>
	
			<p>Depending on your device, you may also be able to obtain a wide array of services based on the location of your device (for example, driving directions, enhanced 411 Directory Assistance, Find My Device, or search results, etc.). These data services, known as Location-Based Services ("LBS") are made available by us and others, usually via applications. These services use various location technologies and acquire location data from various sources.</p>
	
			<p>These applications and services use various location technologies (including Global Positioning Satellite ("GPS"), Assisted GPS ("AGPS"), cell ID and enhanced cell ID technologies) to identify the approximate location of a device, which is then used in conjunction with the application to enhance the user’s experience (for example, to provide driving directions, to provide enhanced 411 Directory Assistance, or search results, etc.)</p>
	
			<p>LBS may, or may not, involve any interaction with or dependency on our network, and location-based services may or may not look to our network to obtain location data. Where we allow third parties the capability of accessing data about your location that is derived from our network, we require those third parties to observe specific privacy and security protections consistent with this policy.</p>
	
			<p>It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device, and that you carefully read and understand the terms under which these services are provided – whether by us or another entity.</p>
	
			<p>You should carefully review the privacy policies and other terms of third-parties with whom you have authorized the sharing of your location information, and you should consider the risks involved in disclosing your location information to other people.</p>
	
			<p>Where we provide a location-based service, you will receive notice of the location features of the service and collection of location data is with your consent. You will be provided options for managing when and how such information should be shared (except in the case of certain parental controls or similar services associated with enterprise or multi-line accounts – for example, T-Mobile’s FamilyWhereTM services – which may be managed solely by the primary account holder or their designee, but always with notice to the end-user). T-Mobile follows the CTIA’s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available <a href="http://www.ctia.org/policy-initiatives/voluntary-guidelines/best-practices-and-guidelines-for-location-based-services">here</a>.</p>

			 <span class="text-bold">Advertising</span>
	
			<p>You may see advertisements when you visit our websites, mobile websites, in mobile applications, or on your device. We may help advertisers better reach our customers by providing certain information, including device type, geographic information, language preferences or demographic information obtained from other companies to allow advertisers to determine which ads may be more relevant to you. However, we do not share Personal Information for advertising purposes outside of our corporate family without your consent.</p>
	
	
	
	
			<p>Some examples of the types of advertising you might see include:</p>
	
	
	
	
			<p><span class="text-italic">Our Ads on Our Websites.</span> We may provide advertisements, such as banner ads, on our websites, mobile websites, and in mobile applications and widgets you may download, access or use on your device.</p>
	
	
	
	
			<p><span class="text-italic">Other Company Ads on Our Websites.</span> You may also see third-party advertisements on some T-Mobile websites, services, or in applications, or on devices. These third-party advertisers, or their ad networks, may place or access cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your device, or use your device identifier, and may collect certain anonymous or de-identified information about your visit on our websites. The third-party advertisers who provide these ads may use this information to provide you with advertising on our websites, as well as on other websites. We do not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer or device by ad servers, ad networks, or third-party advertisers.</p>
	
	
	
	
			<p><span class="text-italic">Our Ads on Other Websites.</span> We may ask third-parties to place advertisements about our products and services on other websites, mobile websites and in mobile applications and widgets. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third-parties on other websites is subject to any applicable privacy policies that they may have, not this Policy.</p>
	
	
	
	
			<p><span class="text-bold">Interest-Based Ads.</span> You may receive ads from us and our ad providers that are tailored to your interests. These interest-based ads are selected based on your use of our services and products as well as other information obtained by us and our ad providers. None of this information is Personal Information.</p>
	
			<ul>
			  <li>We do not provide your Personal Information to third-party advertisers without your consent.</li>
	
			  <li>Advertising may be tailored to the interests that advertisers have inferred from your browsing of our websites or other websites or applications with which the third-party partners to provide advertising.</li>
	
			  <li>We may provide third-party advertisers with aggregated or anonymous, de-identified, demographic or similar data (unrelated to your browsing activities) that does not personally identify you. This data may be used by advertisers to help tailor their ads on our websites, and on other sites and applications.</li>
	
			  <li>We, and our providers, may use an anonymous profile of your web-browsing and application use activity and interests. This profile does not contain information that identifies you personally, but may include a unique or encrypted identifier that enables your device to be matched to a profile of your browsing activity and anonymous characteristics about your interests.</li>
	
			  <li>When we use information associated with your web browsing activities on websites that are not our own to provide interest-based advertising or offers, we will provide you with notice and appropriate choice.</li>
			</ul>
					  <div class="text-bold mb20 ">Choices about Advertising.</div>
	
	<ul>
			  <li>
				<p><span class="text-italic">On Your Mobile Device.</span> Where we offer interest-based ads, you can opt-out of certain interest-based advertising by clicking on the ad options link on or near the advertisement or by clicking <a href="http://iba.t-mobile.com/tmo/">here</a>.</p>
	
				<ul>
				  <li>If you turn off interest-based ads, you will still see just as many ads, but the ads may not be based on your interests and may be less relevant to you.</li>
	
				  <li>Your choice only affects the ads you see on websites and applications you access on your device.</li>
	
				  <li>If your device’s browser cookies are deleted, or your device is reset, you may need to reset the interest-based ads feature.</li>
	
				  <li>If you are using your device, but are not on our network (such as a WiFi network), we, and our ad providers, may not be able to identify your ad choices.</li>
				</ul>
			  </li>
	
			  <li><span class="text-italic">On Your Computer or Non-Mobile Device.</span> For information about targeted advertising, or to opt-out of use of your browser information for purposes of certain third-party advertising, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. Please note that if you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to content on a web page or based on other nonpersonal information. Please note that this opt-out is cookie-based. If you change computers or devices, change web browsers, or delete cookies, you will need to visit the aboutads site and opt-out again.</li>

				<span class="icon-up-top"></span><a href="#top">Top</a>
			</div>
		</div>
			<p>We do not sell, license, rent, or otherwise provide your Personal Information to unaffiliated third-parties (parties outside the T-Mobile corporate family) to market their services or products to you without your consent. We may, however, disclose your information to unaffiliated third-parties as follows:</p>
	
	
			 <span class="text-bold">With Your Consent</span>
	
			<p>We may disclose Personal Information about you to third-parties with your consent. We may obtain your consent in writing; online, through "click-through" agreements; when you accept the terms of disclosures on your phone for certain applications or services; orally, in our stores or on the phone, including through interactive voice response, or implicitly, for example, when you purchase a product and ask that it be shipped to your home, consenting to our disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping company to complete delivery.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">To the Primary Account Holder</span>
	
			<p>We may disclose information about an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide information about you or your use of the service, products or devices to them or others at their direction.</p>
	
			<p>When you are the primary account holder, but you receive special or discounted pricing, terms, or other benefits through another party’s agreement with us (for example, an employee discount), we may provide enough information to that party to verify your initial and continuing eligibility for benefits under their agreement with us and to calculate any associated discounts.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">To Our Service Providers</span>
	
			<p>We may disclose information to third-party vendors and partners who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf (for example, credit/debit card processing, billing, shipping, repair, customer service, auditing, and marketing).</p>
			<span class="text-bold">Third-Party Carriers and Suppliers</span>
	
			<p>If you are roaming on the network of another carrier, your wireless telephone number, your location, the numbers you dial, and other information about your usage will be available to that carrier to facilitate that service. Additionally, services and functionality offered through certain devices are sometimes provided in conjunction with entities other than T-Mobile. As a result, Personal Information from your devices may be uploaded and stored on their servers. For instance, BlackBerry® service is provided in conjunction with Research in Motion (RIM), and Personal Information from your device is stored on their BlackBerry Enterprise ServersTM. Their specific terms and conditions, terms of use, and privacy polices apply to those services.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">In a Business Transfer</span>
	
			<p>We may sell, disclose, or transfer information about you as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint venture, corporate reorganization, financing, or sale of company assets, or in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which such information could be transferred to third-parties as a business asset in the transaction.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">For Legal Process &amp; Protection</span>
	
			<p>We may disclose Personal Information, and other information about you, or your communications, where we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary:</p>
	
			<ul>
			  <li>To satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;</li>
	
			  <li>To enforce or apply agreements, or initiate, render, bill, and collect for services and products (including to collection agencies in order to obtain payment for our products and services);</li>
	
			  <li>To protect our rights or interests, property or safety or that of others;</li>
	
			  <li>In connection with claims, disputes, or litigation – in court or elsewhere;</li>
	
			  <li>To protect users of our services and other carriers or providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services;</li>
	
			  <li>To facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government; or</li>
	
			  <li>In an emergency situation.</li>
			</ul>
			<span class="text-bold">Co-Sponsored Websites and Partners</span>
	
			<p>If you provide information to us in connection with a co-sponsored website, this Policy will apply to our use of the information and the co-sponsor’s policy will apply to their use of the information. If you purchase equipment or activate service at one of our partner’s locations (including websites of such dealer or retailer), they may request information from you that is passed to us as part of the activation process, but which may also be retained by the partner. This Policy will govern our use of such information, and the partner’s privacy policy will govern its use of such information.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">De-Identified Information</span>
	
			<p>We may provide information that does not identify you personally to third-parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes.</p>
			<span class="text-bold">Third-Party Applications for Your Devices</span>
	
			<p>We are not responsible for the third-party applications (for example, applications, programs, widgets, etc.) you select and install on your device. When you install third party applications, you may give your consent for the third party to access information stored on the device and on our network to facilitate the application’s functions (for example, you may consent to third-party access to your location information – see Location Based Services). The manner in which such third-parties may use, share, or disclose such information is governed by the terms and conditions and privacy policy provided by that third party – not by this Policy.

		   <div class="text-bold mt10">Protecting Your Information</div>
	
			<p>We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure while it is under our control.</p>
			<p>We provide password protected online access to your account information through my.t-mobile.com. For multi-line accounts, the primary account holder is authorized to access online account information for all the devices and lines on the account. Other users may generally access online account information related only to their respective device and line (for example, if a parent provides a device to their child, the child may access online information about that device and line– including CPNI). The primary account holder, however, may designate additional or more limited access rights for other users on the account.
			</p>
			<p>Under federal law, you have a right, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of CPNI and we have adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with those rules. We will not intentionally disclose your CPNI to third-parties without your permission, except as allowed under FCC rules, applicable law, or explained in this Policy. However, if you are the primary account holder, you may designate other "authorized users" (for example, a spouse) to access and manage your account information, including CPNI. For more information see <a href="/Company/PrivacyResources.aspx?tp=Abt_Tab_CPNI">Privacy Resources/Customer Proprietary Network Information</a></p>
			<span class="text-bold">Retention and Disposal</span>
	
			<p>We retain information only for as long as we have a business or tax need or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require. When we dispose of Personal Information, we use reasonable procedures designed to erase or render it unreadable (for example, shredding documents and wiping electronic media).</p>

								Billing Information.</a>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Avoiding bill shock.</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">T-Mobile offers our customers a number of ways to avoid potential bill shock from unanticipated voice, messaging, and data overages, through text alerts, online and phone access to account balance information, and family controls.</p>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Overage Alerts.</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">Overage alerts can help you avoid unexpected high wireless bills, and are available to customers on rate plans with limited allotments of minutes, text messages, and/or data. T-Mobile automatically notifies you with a free text message when you come close to exceeding your plan allotments, and again when your allotments are used up. With T-Mobile Overage Alerts, you’ll know when you’re approaching additional charges or reduced data speeds, so you won’t be surprised by a high wireless bill or a slowed data experience.</p>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Data usage</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">For customers on pay-per-use data plans, the first time you access the Internet with your device you will be notified of how your data usage will be charged. Then, a separate message will be sent to the primary account holder to confirm that the device was used for Internet access.</p>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">For data plans with a monthly allotment, T-Mobile will notify you via free text message before you reach your allotted data plan usage, and again when you’ve reached your allotment. This message is also sent to the primary account holder to notify them that you’ve exceeded your limit.</p>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">T-Mobile also offers overage-free mobile broadband data plans. Mobile broadband customers also receive the webConnect Manager software, which allows you to monitor how much data is being used, including an estimate of the amount of usage left on your plan.</p>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">If you're trying to find the right plan for data usage, use our helpful data calculator to quickly assess your monthly data needs. Or if you would like to check your data plan usage, you can view the Data Usage Meter from the myAccount application or by signing in to My T-Mobile.</p>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Message Blocking</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">Message Blocking is a free T-Mobile service that allows you to block messages to and from your phone, to help you avoid unwanted messages.</p>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">You can block incoming and outgoing text messages (SMS), picture messages (MMS), Instant Messages (IM), and email.</p>
							<h6 class="detail" style="display: block;">NOTE:</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">Blocking incoming and outgoing Instant Messages and email applies to phones which use text messaging to send/receive these messages. If you want to be able to send or receive messages, Message Blocking is not the right service for you. Messaging Blocking is intended to block messages in general, not to prevent overage charges.</p>
							<a class="detail" href="javascript:void(0)" style="display: inline-block;">Learn more about Message Blocking</a>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Web Guard</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">Web Guard is a free, optional service which restricts access to adult-oriented content (over 18) on your phone when you use the T-Mobile network. While Web Guard can be a big help, it's not foolproof. It may or may not block or filter some content, including user-generated content such as Instant Messaging (IM), email, and text messages. But it's a good start.</p>
							<a class="detail" href="javascript:void(0)" style="display: inline-block;">Learn more about Message Blocking</a>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Content Blocking</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">Content Blocking allows you to block T-Mobile downloadable content&mdash;games, ringtones, wallpaper, and CallerTunes&reg;&mdash;from your handset. This free feature can help you avoid unwanted charges from downloadable content.</p>
							<a class="detail" href="javascript:void(0)" style="display: inline-block;">Learn more about content blocking</a>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Family Allowances</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">Family Allowances&reg; makes it easy for parents to keep control of their wireless account and avoid unexpected overage charges, by setting upfront limits on family plan minutes, messages, and downloads.</p>
							<a class="detail" href="javascript:void(0)" style="display: inline-block;">Learn more about Family Allowances</a>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">International Usage Alerts</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">When traveling internationally, T-Mobile sends a text message to alert you to applicable charges for voice, text, and data while roaming. And in order to get the best rates while abroad, T-Mobile encourages you to call T-Mobile for international rates and options.</p>
							<a class="detail" href="javascript:void(0)" style="display: inline-block;">Learn more about international services</a>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Check account usage and balance:</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">Not only can you check your usage online, T-Mobile also offers customers the ability to check account usage at any time of day for free, right on your T-Mobile phone. Check your minute usage and balance from your phone by using My Account or by dialing the following short codes:</p>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Check minutes used:</h6>
							<div class="detail pl20" style="display: block;">Dial #MIN# (#646#) and press Send</div>

							<div class="detail pl20" style="display: block;">Dial #BAL# (#225#) and press Send</div>
							<a class="detail mt10" href="javascript:void(0)" style="display: inline-block;">Learn more about checking your usage and balance</a>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">My Account app</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">Some T-Mobile phones are pre-loaded with the free T-Mobile myAccount Android&trade; app. myAccount allows you to receive free minutes usage alerts (you may also use myAccount to enable and disable those usage alerts), payment reminders, billing summaries, and other service-related information.</p>
							<a class="detail" href="javascript:void(0)" style="display: inline-block;">Learn how to get the myAccount app</a>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Third-party service provider billing</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">Certain third-party charges (games, apps, ringtones, etc.) may be included on your T-Mobile bill. If you want to block those third-party charges from being included on your T-Mobile bill, you may do so at no charge by visiting <a href="javascript:void(0)">www.my.T-Mobile.com</a> or calling T-Mobile Customer Service.</p>
							<h6 class="detail mt20" style="display: block;">Stolen Devices</h6>
							<p class="detail" style="display: block;">T-Mobile, along with CTIA, is committed to stopping the theft of mobile devices. Devices reported stolen will not work on the T-Mobile network or on most other networks around the world. If you wish to verify if a particular device has been reported stolen you may do so by online. <a href="javascript:void(0)">Learn More</a>

								<h5 class="color-gray-dark mb15">Accessibility Policy</h5>
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">T-Mobile is committed to providing products and services that meet a variety of communication needs.</h5>
								<h5 class="pt40">Hearing aid compatibility</h5>
								<hr class="border-gray mt10 mb10">
								<p>Some hearing aid users may detect interference in the form of a buzzing, humming, or whining noise when using a wireless phone. The amount of interference experienced may vary due to immunity level differences of hearing aids.</p>
								<p>A rating system (M1 through M4 for microphone or T1 through T4 for telecoil) is used to assist consumers with identifying handsets designed to be compatible with hearing aids. FCC rules require labeling of phones that receive a rating of 3 or 4, which are deemed to be hearing aid compatible. Phones that receive a rating of 3 or 4 usually cause the least amount of interference. Typically, the higher the M or T rating assigned to a phone, the less interference.</p>
								<p>Although the rating system is not a guarantee, it is a useful tool for consumers to determine the most appropriate wireless handset.</p>
								<p>For additional information about hearing aid compatibility with digital wireless phones, see the <a href="#">Hearing aid compatibility</a> brochure and the <a href="#">FCC Guide.</a>
								</p>
								<h5 class="pt40"><em>Important Note:</em></h5>
								<hr class="border-gray mt10 mb10">
								<p><em>These phones have been tested and rated for use with hearing aids for some of the wireless technologies that they use. However, there may be some newer wireless technologies used in these phones that have not been tested yet for use with hearing aids. It is important to try the different features of your phone thoroughly and in different locations, using your hearing aid or cochlear implant, to determine if you hear any interfering noise. Consult your service provider or the manufacturer of your phone for information on hearing aid compatibility. If you have questions about return or exchange policies, consult your service provider or phone retailer.</em>
								</p>
								<p><em>Handsets with Wi-Fi or Voice Over LTE (VoLTE) calling capabilities may not have been tested for hearing aid compatibility in these calling modes.</em>

								<hr class="border-gray mt10 mb10">
								<p>TTY, also known as Text Telephone Device or Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD), is a special device required at both ends of the conversation that enables people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech-impaired to use the telephone to communicate. TTY works by allowing people to type messages back and forth to one another instead of talking and listening.</p>
								<p>The FCC requires digital wireless carriers to have the capability to transmit a call from a wireless phone that is connected to a TTY. While the FCC mandate pertains specifically to calls made to 9-1-1, the ability to make a call to 9-1-1 means that they can also complete a call to anyone, anywhere, provided the party on the receiving end of the call also has a TTY.</p>
								<h5 class="mt40">TTY on T-Mobile's network</h5>
								<hr class="border-gray mt10 mb10">
								<p>T-Mobile’s network is TTY compatible. All T-Mobile price plans and most handset features will work with TTY. Customers will need to visit a T-Mobile retail store or contact Customer Service for assistance with selecting the proper rate plan and service activation.</p>

					<h5 class="color-gray-dark mb15">Consumer Code</h5>
					<h5 class="pt20">Consumer Code for Wireless Service</h5>
					<p>To provide consumers with information to help them make informed choices when selecting wireless service, the CTIA and the wireless carriers that are signatories below have developed the following Consumer Code. The carriers that are signatories to this Code have voluntarily adopted the principles, disclosures, and practices here for wireless service provided to individual consumers, including voice, messaging, and data services sold either on a postpaid or prepaid basis.</p>
					<h5 class="pt30 text-uppercase">THE WIRELESS CARRIERS THAT ARE SIGNATORIES TO THIS CODE WILL:</h5>
					<div class="pl30">
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">ONE</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">DISCLOSE RATES AND TERMS OF SERVICE TO CONSUMERS</h5>
						<p>For each service plan offered to new consumers, wireless carriers will disclose to consumers at point of sale and on their web sites, at least the following information, as applicable: (a) the coverage area for the service; (b) any activation or initiation fee; (c) the monthly access fee or base charge; (d) the amount and nature of any voice, messaging, or data allowances included in the plan (such as night and weekend minutes); (e) the charges for domestic usage in excess of any included allowances or outside of the coverage area; (f) for prepaid service plans, the period of time during which any balance is available for use; (g) whether there are prohibitions on data service usage and whether there are network management practices that will have a material impact on the customer’s wireless data experience; (h) whether any additional taxes, fees or surcharges apply; (i) the amount or range of any such fees or surcharges that are collected and retained by the carrier; (j) the amount or nature of any late payment fee; (k) whether a fixed-term contract is required and its duration; (l) the amount and nature of any early termination fee that may apply; and (m) the trial period during which a consumer may cancel service without any early termination fee, as long as the consumer complies with any applicable return policy.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">TWO</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">MAKE AVAILABLE MAPS SHOWING WHERE SERVICE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE</h5>
						<p>Wireless carriers will make available at point of sale and on their web sites maps depicting approximate domestic coverage applicable to each of their service plans currently offered to consumers. To enable consumers to make comparisons among carriers, these maps will be generated using generally accepted methodologies and standards to depict the carrier’s outdoor coverage. All such maps will contain or link to an appropriate legend concerning limitations and/or variations in wireless coverage and map usage, including any geographic limitations on the availability of any services included in the plan. Wireless carriers will periodically update such maps as necessary to keep them reasonably current. If necessary to show the extent of service coverage available to customers from carriers’ roaming partners, carriers will request and incorporate coverage maps from roaming partners that are generated using similar industry-accepted criteria, or if such information is not available, incorporate publicly available information regarding roaming partners’ coverage areas.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">THREE</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">PROVIDE CONTRACT TERMS TO CUSTOMERS AND CONFIRM CHANGES IN SERVICE</h5>
						<p>When a customer initiates new service or a change in existing service, the carrier will provide or confirm any new material terms and conditions of the ongoing service with the customer.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">FOUR</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">ALLOW A TRIAL PERIOD FOR NEW SERVICE</h5>
						<p>When a customer initiates postpaid service with a wireless carrier, the customer will be informed of and given a period of not less than 14 days to try out the service. The carrier will not impose an early termination fee if the customer cancels service within this period, provided that the customer complies with applicable return and/or exchange policies. Other charges, including usage charges, may still apply.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">FIVE</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">PROVIDE SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES IN ADVERTISING</h5>
						<p>In advertising of prices for wireless service plans or devices, wireless carriers will disclose material charges and conditions related to the advertised prices and services, including if applicable and to the extent the advertising medium reasonably allows: (a) whether activation or initiation fees apply; (b) monthly access fees or base charges; (c) the amount and nature of any voice, messaging, or data service allowances included in the plan; (d) the charges for any domestic usage in excess of any included allowances or outside of the coverage area; (e) for prepaid service plans, the period of time during which any balance is available for use; (f) whether there are network management practices that will have a material impact on the customer’s wireless data experience; (g) whether any additional taxes, fees or surcharges apply; (h) the amount or range of any such fees or surcharges that are collected and retained by the carrier; (i) whether a fixed-term contract is required and its duration; (j) early termination fees; (k) the terms and conditions related to receiving a product or service for "free;" (l) for any service plan advertised as "nationwide," (or using similar terms), the carrier will have available substantiation for this claim; and (i) whether prices or benefits apply only for a limited time or promotional period and, if so, whether any different fees or charges will apply for the remainder of the contract term.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">SIX</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">SEPARATELY IDENTIFY CARRIER CHARGES FROM TAXES ON BILLING STATEMENTS</h5>
						<p>On customers' bills, carriers will distinguish (a) monthly charges for service and features, and other charges collected and retained by the carrier, from (b) taxes, fees and other charges collected by the carrier and remitted to federal state or local governments. Carriers will not label cost recovery fees or charges as taxes.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">SEVEN</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE SERVICE FOR CHANGES TO CONTRACT TERMS</h5>
						<p>Carriers will not modify the material terms of their postpaid customers’ contracts in a manner that is materially adverse to those customers without providing a reasonable advance notice of a proposed modification and allowing those customers a time period of not less than 14 days to cancel their contracts with no early termination fee.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">EIGHT</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">PROVIDE READY ACCESS TO CUSTOMER SERVICE</h5>
						<p>Customers will be provided a toll-free telephone number to access a carrier’s customer service during normal business hours. Customer service contact information will be provided to customers online and on billing statements. Each wireless carrier will provide information about how customers can contact the carrier in writing, by toll-free telephone number, via the Internet or otherwise with any inquiries or complaints, and this information will be included, at a minimum, on all billing statements, in written responses to customer inquiries and on carriers’ web sites. Each carrier will also make such contact information available, upon request, to any customer calling the carrier’s customer service departments.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">NINE</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">PROMPTLY RESPOND TO CONSUMER INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS RECEIVED FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES</h5>
						<p>Wireless carriers will respond in writing to state or federal administrative agencies within 30 days of receiving written consumer complaints from any such agency.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">TEN</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">ABIDE BY POLICIES FOR PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER PRIVACY</h5>
						<p>Each wireless carrier will abide by a policy regarding the privacy of customer information in accordance with applicable federal and state laws, and will make available to the public its privacy policy concerning information collected online. Each wireless carrier will abide by the CTIA Best Practices and Guidelines for Location-Based Services.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">ELEVEN</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH FREE NOTIFICATIONS FOR VOICE, DATA AND MESSAGING USAGE, AND INTERNATIONAL ROAMING</h5>
						<p>Each wireless provider will provide, at no charge: (a) a notification to consumers of currently-offered and future domestic wireless plans that include limited data allowances when consumers approach and exceed their allowance for data usage and will incur overage charges; (b) a notification to consumers of currently-offered and future domestic voice and messaging plans that include limited voice and messaging allowances when consumers approach and exceed their allowance for those services and will incur overage charges; and (c) a notification to consumers without an international roaming plan/package whose devices have registered abroad and who may incur charges for international usage. Wireless providers will generate the notifications described above to postpaid consumers based on information available at the time the notification is sent. Wireless consumers will not have to affirmatively sign up in order for these notifications to be sent. Each wireless provider shall provide its customers at least two of these alerts by October 17, 2012 and all of these alerts by April 17, 2013. Wireless providers will clearly and conspicuously disclose tools or services that enable consumers to track, monitor and/or set limits on voice, messaging and data usage.</p>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pt20">TWELVE</h5>
						<h5 class="text-uppercase pb10">MOBILE WIRELESS DEVICE UNLOCKING</h5>
						<p>Each wireless provider will abide by the following standards regarding the ability of customers, former customers, and individual owners of eligible devices to unlock phones and tablets, (“mobile wireless devices”) that are locked by or at the direction of the carrier. It should be noted that carriers typically use different frequencies and air interface technologies to provide wireless network access. Accordingly, a device that works on one carrier’s network may not be technologically compatible with another carrier’s network. “Unlocking” a device refers only to disabling software that would prevent a consumer from attempting to activate a device designed for one carrier’s network on another carrier’s network, even if that network is technologically compatible. In other words, “unlocking” a device will not necessarily make a device interoperable with other networks-a device designed for one network is not made technologically compatible with another network merely by “unlocking” it. Additionally, unlocking a device may enable some functionality of the device but not all (e.g., an unlocked device may support voice services but not data services when activated on a different network).</p>
						<p class="mb0">Each wireless provider agrees to abide by the following six principles:</p>
						<p class="mb0">(1) Disclosure. Each carrier will post on its website its clear, concise, and readily accessible policy on postpaid and prepaid mobile wireless device unlocking;</p>
						<p class="mb0">(2) Postpaid Unlocking Policy. Carriers upon request, will unlock mobile wireless devices or provide the necessary information to unlock their devices for their customers and former customers in good standing and individual owners of eligible devices after the fulfillment of the applicable postpaid service contract, device financing plan, or payment of applicable early termination fee.</p>
						<p class="mb0">(3) Prepaid Unlocking Policy. Carriers, upon request, will unlock prepaid mobile wireless devices no later than one year after initial activation, consistent with reasonable time, payment or usage requirements.</p>
						<p class="mb0">(4) Notice. Carriers that lock devices will clearly notify customers that their devices are eligible for unlocking at the time when their devices are eligible for unlocking or automatically unlock devices remotely when devices are eligible for unlocking, without additional fee. Carriers reserve the right to charge non-customers/non-former-customers with a reasonable fee for unlocking requests. Notice to prepaid customers may occur at point of sale, at the time of eligibility, or through a clear and concise statement of policy on the carrier’s website.</p>
						<p class="mb0">(5) Response Time. Within two business days after receiving a request, carriers will unlock eligible mobile wireless devices or initiate a request to the OEM to unlock the eligible device, or provide an explanation of why the device does not qualify for unlocking, or why the carrier reasonably needs additional time to process the request.</p>
						<p class="mb0">(6) Deployed Personnel Unlocking Policy. Carriers will unlock mobile wireless devices for deployed military personnel who are customers in good standing upon provision of deployment papers.</p>
						<p class="mb0">Carriers reserve the right to decline an unlock request if they have a reasonable basis to believe the request is fraudulent or the device is stolen. Carriers further agree to implement three of the standards articulated above within 3 months from February 11, 2014. Carriers further commit to implement the remainder of the principles within 12 months from February 11, 2014.</p>

						<li><a href="#">Business and Government Plans </a>(<a href="#">http://business.t-mobile.com/</a>)</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mt30">Schools and libraries seeking to participate in the E-Rate program may be eligible to purchase Broadband Internet Access Services under existing contracts between T-Mobile and government agencies. Schools and libraries interested in learning about eligibility to purchase under these contracts and the Broadband Internet Access Services available under these contracts should contact their account representative.</p>
					<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt30">What terms and conditions apply to T-Mobile’s Broadband Internet Access Services?</h5>
					<p>Broadband Internet Access Services are subject to the T-Mobile <a href="#">Terms and Conditions at http://www.t-mobile.com/company/website/termsconditions.aspx.</a> Specific information about our Broadband Internet Access Services can be found under the heading “Data Plans and Other Features”. Certain uses of our network are also prohibited as described in our Terms and Conditions under the heading “Misuse of Service or Device.”</p>
					<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt30">What speeds and performance can T-Mobile Broadband Internet Access Services customers expect? Where are these speeds available?</h5>
					<p>Many factors affect the speed and performance that customers experience, including the programs running on the device, your proximity to a cell site, the capacity of the cell site, the surrounding terrain, use inside a building or moving vehicle, radio frequency interference, and how many other customers are attempting to use the same spectrum resources. Customer devices have varying speed capabilities and may connect to different networks depending on technology. Even within coverage areas and with broadband-capable devices, network changes, traffic volume, outages, technical limitations, signal strength, obstructions, weather, and other conditions may interfere with speeds and availability.</p>
					<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt30">Speed</h5
                    >
						<p>The term “speed” is commonly used as a shorthand way to describe the capacity at which a particular broadband Internet access service can transmit data. This capacity is typically measured in the number of kilobits or megabits that can be transmitted in one second (Kbps or Mbps). Some applications like email or basic web browsing do not require a substantial amount of speed to function optimally, while other activities like transferring large data files can be performed faster with higher-speed services.</p>
						<p class="mt30 mb30">Based on our internal testing and testing commissioned from third-party vendors, T-Mobile expects customers with broadband-capable devices will experience the following speeds on our network:</p>
						<ul class="pl15 text-left mb10 list-style-disc">
							<li>4G (LTE) network: typical download speeds of 6-20 Mbps and upload speeds of 2 - 5 Mbps.</li>
							<li>4G (HSPA+ Dual Carrier/42 UMTS) network: typical download speeds of 4-11 Mbps and upload speeds of 500-1800 Kbps.</li>
							<li>4G (HSPA+ 21 UMTS) network: typical download speeds of 2 - 6 Mbps and upload speeds of 500– 1800 Kbps.</li>
							<li>3G (HSPA UMTS) network: typical download speeds of 400 – 700 Kbps and upload speeds of 100 - 250 Kbps.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>For 4G and 3G coverage information, see <a href="#">t-mobile-coverage.t-mobile.com</a></p>
						<div class="clearfix">
							<hr class="hr-width clearfix pull-left color-black mt10 mb10">
						</div>
						<p>Your 4G speed range will depend on your device as well as the factors described above. You can learn more about the capabilities of our 4G devices here (http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/?shape=smp). Customers using a 4G device within the 4G coverage area can expect to get 4G speeds. Customers using a 3G device within the 3G coverage area can expect to get 3G speeds. Customers with 4G devices will access the 3G network where it’s available outside the 4G coverage area. </p>
						<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt30">Latency</h5>
					<p>Latency, also known as delay, is the amount of time from when a data packet is sent to when it is received. For broadband Internet access services, latency is usually expressed as the round-trip time in milliseconds (“ms”) that it takes for a data packet to travel between two end points on the Internet (from point A to point B and then back to point A). Some applications, such as email, can tolerate a substantial amount of latency without any noticeable impact on the application's performance, while other applications, such as real-time video conferencing, require lower latency to function properly.</p>
					<p class="mt30">With respect to latency for use of real-time data applications, T-Mobile expects round trip network to device latency to be approximately 35 – 90 ms on its 4G LTE network, 60 – 180 ms on its 4G network and 100-450 ms on its 3G network.</p>
					<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt30">How does T-Mobile manage the flow of data on its network?</h5>
					<p>We manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services. Additionally, we may implement other network management practices to provide the best online experience possible for our customers, such as caching less data, using less capacity, sizing video more appropriately for a device to transmit data files more efficiently, and giving data of T-Mobile-branded customers precedence over data of non-T-Mobile-branded customers when the network is presented with competing demands. Giving T-Mobile data precedence occurs only on a content-agnostic basis, and its effect should be noticed rarely and temporarily, if at all. These practices do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those offered by T-Mobile or any T-Mobile affiliate on the basis of such competition. While we avoid changing text, image, and video files in the compression process when practical, the process may impact the appearance of files as displayed on a device.</p>
					<p class="mt30">To provide a good experience for the majority of our customers and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we may also take measures including temporarily reducing data throughput for a subset of customers who use a disproportionate amount of bandwidth. Customers who use more data than 95% of customers on the same rate plan typically use in a month may, during times and places of congestion, have their data usage prioritized below other customers. (Customers who use data in violation of their Rate Plan terms or T-Mobile's Terms and Conditions may be excluded from this calculation.) If total usage exceeds 5GB (amount subject to change without notice; please check T-Mobile's Terms and Conditions on www.T-Mobile.com for updates) or the amount specified in your data plan during a billing cycle, we may reduce your data speed for the remainder of that billing cycle. If you use your Data Plan in a manner that could interfere with other customers' service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers, or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your data session, or switch you to a more appropriate Data Plan.</p>
					<h5 class="color-gray-dark mt30">What security measures does T-Mobile use to protect its Broadband Internet Access Services?</h5>
					<p>We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect our network from events that may negatively impact our customers’ ability to use our Broadband Internet Access Services. We monitor our network to protect against security threats, including spam, viruses, automated attacks, worms, distributed denial of service attacks, and other potentially malicious activity. When we detect a threat, we will attempt to prevent it from spreading across our network using a variety of security measures, which may include rerouting or limiting some traffic over our network until the threat is resolved.</p>

					<p class="mt30">Unless part of an opted-in customer service, T-Mobile does not block lawful traffic based on content or subject. Occasionally, cases arise where T-Mobile must make a judgment, determining that the value of protecting our entire customer base from malicious or other adverse, network-impacting traffic outweighs access issues experienced by a few.

							<div class="detail mt10">
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">Customer/Authorized-User Verification</h5>
								<p class="mb20">As a T-Mobile customer, you have a right, and T-Mobile has a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your account information. We take this obligation seriously and do everything possible to ensure that your account information is not shared with others without your consent. Specifically, we have implemented various policies and measures to ensure that our interactions are with you or those you authorize to interact with us on your behalf – and not with others pretending to be you or claiming a right to access your information. These procedures vary based upon the many ways you may contact us. But all are designed to balance your privacy interests with your need for legitimate access to your account information.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="detail mt10">
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">When You Call Us</h5>
								<p class="mb20">When you call T-Mobile, you will generally be asked to verify certain personal information to establish your identity as our customer or someone our customer has authorized to act on their behalf. If you have requested the use of a customer care password on your account, you will be asked to verify that password. To establish such a password, we will initially send a one-time, randomly-generated PIN to you by SMS text and require you to respond by providing the PIN to our representative.</p>
								<p class="mb20">Unless we can verify the caller’s identity through these methods, our policy is not to release any account specific information over the phone. We can, however, provide generic help (e.g., troubleshooting or information about our product and service offerings) without verification. With the exception of T-Mobile Puerto Rico, T-Mobile’s policy is generally not to disclose call detail information (i.e., specific information about the calls you’ve made or received) over the telephone in response to customer-initiated telephone contacts, even if the account has otherwise been verified. If you provide the specifics of a call, however, our representatives are free to discuss the call record with you.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="detail mt10">
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">When You Visit Our Retail Locations</h5>
								<p class="mb20">When you visit a T-Mobile retail location, you will generally be required to present a valid government-issued photo ID matching the customer’s account information (or that of an authorized user on the account). This verification method is mandated by the FCC for access to most account information, and is designed to protect your privacy. Once again, we can provide non-account-specific information (e.g., troubleshooting or information about our product and service offerings) without account verification. But, with the exception of pre-paid accounts – which utilize a PIN for authentication – photo-identification is required for all other account access in our stores.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="detail mt10">
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">When You Visit Us Online</h5>
								<p class="mb20">T-Mobile is dedicated to providing a robust and easy-to-use online experience at <a href="https://my.t-mobile.com/login/MyTmobileLogin.aspx">MyT-Mobile.com</a>. Each user of a T-Mobile phone number is permitted to create an online account – initially established through use of a randomly-generated PIN delivered to phone by SMS text message. After the online account is initially established, the user will be required to create a password for future access. The Primary Account Holder – the customer who is financially responsible for the account – can designate greater or lesser online account access for other users on the account by setting preferences on the account.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="detail mt10">
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">When You Access Account Information Directly From Your Mobile Device</h5>
								<p class="mb20">T-Mobile is also dedicated to providing our customers easy account access through their mobile device(s). The verification procedures we utilize in these instances vary, depending on numerous factors. But in many cases, the authentication can occur within the network without further input from the customer.</p>
								<p class="mb20">If you have a question about our account verification requirements, you may contact us by dialing 611 from your T-Mobile phone or 1-800-937-8997 from any phone, or you may contact our privacy office by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:Privacy@T-Mobile.com">Privacy@T-Mobile.com</a>

								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">Security and Your Wireless Device</h5>
								<p class="mb20">Along with the considerable resources T-Mobile has and will continue to dedicate to customer security, there are some specific actions you can take to help protect your mobile phone accounts, voicemail, and personal data.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Utilize passwords to safeguard your personal information in the following three areas:
										<ul>
											<li>On MyT-Mobile.com - the Web self-service tool</li>
											<li>Attached to your account, when calling Customer Care</li>
											<li>On your voicemail box</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Be sure your password to access My T-Mobile has a combination of letters and numbers.</li>
									<li>Change your passwords at least every 60 days.</li>
									<li>Don’t use the same password for all systems or providers that require one.</li>
									<li>Make your password easy to remember but difficult for others to guess.</li>
									<li>Don't store your passwords on any computer system.</li>
									<li>Never give out your passwords, even to friends or family.</li>
									<li>Never give your password for online access over the phone or in an e-mail.</li>
									<li>Never leave your wireless device unattended in a public place, or visible in your car.</li>
									<li>If you lose a device, or there is suspicious activity on your account, call T-Mobile immediately.</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="mb20">If you have a question about password protection, you may contact us by dialing 611 from your T-Mobile phone or 1-800-937-8997 from any phone, or you may contact our privacy office at any time by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:Privacy@T-Mobile.com">Privacy@T-Mobile.com</a>.</p>

							<div class="detail mt10">
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">Keeping Your Phone Records Safe Against Pretexting</h5>
								<p class="mb20">T-Mobile is committed to gaining and maintaining the trust of our customers. At the heart of this relationship is T-Mobile’s promise to protect our customers’ private information. We have implemented numerous safeguards and continually monitor the security of our customers’ information.</p>
								<p class="mb20">One method used by unauthorized persons in an effort to obtain access to such information is “pretexting.” Pretexting occurs when a person poses as someone else in order to gain access to calling records or other account information. Although pretexting can involve professional imposters (e.g., those offering to obtain records for a fee), it more commonly involves acquaintances of the account holder (e.g., an ex-spouse or a family member). In either event, the practice is illegal and the pretexter may be subject to criminal liability.</p>
								<p class="mb20">T-Mobile utilizes a range of identity verification processes to protect against pretexting. These processes help ensure that customer information is only released to authorized individuals. More importantly, T-Mobile does not provide detailed calling record information over the phone to inbound callers (except in limited circumstances in Puerto Rico – based upon the use of a unique PIN process).</p>
								<p class="mb20">You can also help protect your own phone records by placing a password on your T-Mobile account. You can do this quickly and easily by calling Customer Service by dialing 611 from your T-Mobile phone, or by calling Customer Service at 1-800-937-8997 from any phone.</p>
								<p class="mb20">By working together, we can continue to help ensure that your private information remains secure.</p>

								WiFi Security</a>
							<div class="detail mt10">
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">Improving Safety and Security on WiFi Networks</h5>
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark">WiFi networks</h5>
								<p class="mb20">are incredibly convenient, but also present security risks. Most public WiFi hotspots don’t encrypt the information you send over the internet and are not secure. If you use an unsecured WiFi network and log in to an unencrypted website, your personal information (passwords, financial information, contacts, photos, etc.) could be at risk. If you use an unsecured network to log in to an unencrypted site – or a site that uses encryption only on the sign-in page – other users on the network may be able to see what you send. Hackers could hijack your session and log in as you.</p>
								<p class="mb20">Here are some quick tips to help you increase security when using WiFi networks:</p>
								<ul class="mb20">
									<li>Avoid sending passwords, credit card numbers, or other financial information over a public WiFi network.
									</li>
									<li>Use security technologies whenever possible:
										<p class="ml30 mt20">
											A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network" target="_blank">virtual private network ("VPN")</a> encrypts traffic between your device and the Internet even on an unsecured WiFi network. There are a host of VPN service providers that provide personal VPN accounts. Many companies provide VPNs for their employees to help ensure secure remote access.
											<br>Use websites that offer secure socket layer ("SSL") encryption technology. SSL technology is the standard for data encryption and for secure web-based transactions (such as e-commerce). To confirm that a website is using SSL, look for the "HTTPS://..." in the URL address. Note: the padlock symbol that appears on some browsers is not assurance that the connection is safe and secure. Always check to see that the URL starts with the “HTTPS://...”
											<br>Double check the Web site address in your browser's URL field to ensure you are communicating with the correct and secure Web site – some malicious websites are designed to look like legitimate services and or may be requesting your login information with a URL that starts with HTTP:// instead of the secure HTTPS://.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>• Always keep your anti-malware software up-to-date by allowing the software to update its file of know issues (called signatures) as often as it needs to (could be several times per day or week). T-Mobile offers <a href="http://newsroom.t-mobile.com/news/t-mobile-and-lookout-team-up-to-bring-leading-mobile-security-solution-to-protect-customers-devices.htm" target="_blank">Lookout anti-malware software</a> for the smartphones and tablets we carry.</li>
									<li>If you are using your smartphone, tablet, or PC as an access point for other devices to connect to the Internet – ALWAYS enable at least<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access" target="_blank">WPA (preferably use WPA2) security</a> then use a pre-shared key (PSK) (password) of at least 16 characters long using a mixture of lower-case & upper-case letters, numbers</li>
									<li>Don’t stay permanently signed in to accounts. When you’ve finished using an account, properly log out before you type in a new Internet address or close you browser.</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="mb20">T-Mobile encourages the use of customer-provided security solutions, such as personal firewalls, anti-malware software and the use of websites that provide a secure connection (remember the HTTPS://... at the start of the URL) for your sensitive data. It is your responsibility, to take precautions and adopt security measures best suited to your situation and intended use of the service as T-Mobile does not currently provide these solutions and we cannot guarantee or otherwise be responsible for their effectiveness.</p>

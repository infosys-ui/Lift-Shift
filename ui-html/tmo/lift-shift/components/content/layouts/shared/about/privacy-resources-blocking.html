								<h4 class="color-gray-dark mb30">Anonymous Callers</h4>
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark mb20">Blocking Anonymous Callers</h5>
								<p class="mb20">When you use T-Mobile communications services to receive calls, the telephone number of the calling party is generally delivered to your mobile device, allowing you to identify the number (and the name you may have entered into your contacts) of a caller before answering. However, the FCC has mandated that carriers allow callers the ability to block their Caller ID information and thus place &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; calls. T-Mobile is obligated to honor the privacy of the caller in these circumstances. Of course, you may choose not to accept such calls. But we cannot block the call or override the privacy choice of the caller.</p>
								<p class="lh1-25-xs">Similarly, when you make a call from a T-Mobile device, you may choose to block your Caller-ID information, which you can generally do by dialing *67 prior to dialing the called party's number. Refer to the specific instructions for your communication device regarding Caller ID Blocking for other or different dialing instructions. Please note, however, that Caller ID Blocking does not prevent the display of your information when you dial certain business numbers, including 911, 900 numbers, or toll-free numbers. For more specific information or instructions, you may reach a customer service representative by dialing 611 from your T-Mobile phone or 1-800-937-8997 from any phone.</p>

								<h4 class="color-gray-dark mb30">Call and Message Blocking</h4>
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark mb20">Blocking Specific Calls and Messages</h5>
								<p class="mt20">Mobile communications create invaluable opportunities for staying connected with family and friends. Because we keep our mobile devices with us at most times, we are connected virtually 24/7. Although most of us enjoy this convenience, there may be times when you wish you could block contacts (calls or texts) by a specific person. Although T-Mobile isn't currently able to selectively block incoming calls or texts from individual numbers through the network (except in the case of certain Family Allowance functions - see <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="">Family Allowances)</a>, many of our devices offer such capabilities on the handset itself. You can find information about your specific devices at <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="">www.t-mobile.com</a>. Alternatively, you may reach a customer service representative by dialing 611 from your T-Mobile phone or 1-800-937-8997 from any phone. They can assist you with information about whether your device provides this capability.</p>
								<p>If you are receiving unwanted telemarketing calls, you can register with the Do Not Call registry by calling 1-888-382-1222, or online at <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="">www.donotcall.gov</a>.</p>

							<!--Blocking Parental Blocking Start-->
							<section class="detail">
								<h4 class="color-gray-dark mb30">Parental Blocking</h4>
								<h5 class="color-gray-dark mb20">Blocking Using Family Allowances</h5>
								<p class="mb20">Through the optional Family Allowances services, T-Mobile offers parents additional blocking controls. Family Allowances is a service easily managed from <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="">MyT - Mobile.com</a> that primarily lets you assign allowances for minutes, messages, and downloads to all the lines on your account. However, it also allows parents the options to set <b>Always Allowed</b>&#8480; numbers to enable unlimited calling or texting and <b>Never Allowed</b>&#8480; numbers to restrict calling or texting, and allow blocking of usage during certain times of day (conditions and restrictions apply).</p>
								<p>Active T-Mobile customers with two or more lines of service on one account can generally add Family Allowances. Family Allowances is not available, however, for certain specific account types. For more detailed information on Family Allowances and the <b>Always Allowed</b>&#8480; and <b>Never Allowed</b>&#8480; feature, please visit <a href="javascript:void(0)" title="">Family Allowances FAQs</a> or you may reach a customer service representative by dialing 611 from your T-Mobile phone or 1-800-937-8997 from any phone.</p>

							<!--Blocking Third-Party Charges Start-->
							<section class="detail">
								<h4 class="color-gray-dark mb30">Blocking Third-Party Charges</h4>
								<p class="mb20">T-Mobile provides you with the ability to purchase various services and products from certain third-party service providers (e.g., games, apps, ringtones, etc.) and have the charges for those services or products included on your T-Mobile bill. You are responsible for all charges on your T-Mobile bill. You have the option, at no additional charge, to block the ability to have third-party charges included on your T-Mobile bill. Unless you choose to activate this blocking option, you authorize T-Mobile to place those charges on your bill when you purchase those products or services.</p>

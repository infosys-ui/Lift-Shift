									<h5 class="border-top-eee pt10">Important Notice about Domestic Data Use While Off the T-Mobile Network</h5>
									<hr class="hr-new mt5" />
									<p class="lh25-new mt30">Beginning on April 5, 2012 there will be a limit on the amount of data that can be used while a T-Mobile customer’s device is connected to another provider’s network (“off-network” or “domestic roaming”). Customers that are domestically roaming will receive free text message usage alerts for data. If the roaming data limit is exceeded for a Rate Plan, then data service will be suspended from off-network roaming until the start of the next bill cycle or a qualifying change is made to the Rate Plan. This will not impact: (1) voice usage, and (2) data usage on the T-Mobile network.</p>
									<p class="lh25-new mt30">To determine domestic roaming areas, see the T-Mobile data coverage map by visiting <a href="#">www.T-Mobile.com/Coverage</a>. The domestic roaming data allowance for each Rate Plan is outlined in the chart below. To use this chart, review the Current Rate Plan Full Speed Data Allotment column to identify the megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB) included in your Rate Plan, and then see the domestic roaming data usage limit that applies on the right. The megabytes or gigabytes for a Rate Plan can often be found by reviewing the Available Service section on page 1 of the bill (ex: Classic Simple 200MB Data Promo) or by dialing #WEB# send from your mobile phone.</p>

										<a class="pull-right" href="#">top</a> 
									</div>
									<p class="lh25-new mt10">To continue providing the most competitive pricing options in the industry, T-Mobile has chosen to introduce a domestic data roaming allotment on all data plans. Very few customers will use enough domestic data while roaming to be impacted by this change. Domestic roaming allotments are used across the wireless industry and so this is common with other carriers as well.</p>

									<div class="hr-new clearfix mt30 links">
										<h5 class="pull-left color-gray-dark">How do I know if I am roaming domestically? </h5>
										<a class="pull-right" href="#">top</a> 
									</div>
									<p class="lh25-new mt10">The best way to determine your active network is to go into the handset settings and look for the mobile network or phone status options. This specific process varies by device and we advise you consult your <a href="#">user guide</a> for details. Many devices, however, including BlackBerry will display “T-Mobile” on the home screen anytime you are on the T-Mobile network. If your handset doesn’t display this information on the home screen, it may display it on the screen that shows when the device is locked. In addition to your device display, you can review the T-Mobile coverage map prior to traveling to determine if your destination is within the T-Mobile coverage area. See <a href="#">Personal Coverage Check</a> and select Data.</p>

										<h5 class="pull-left color-gray-dark">How much data can I use each month while roaming domestically? </h5>
										<a class="pull-right" href="#">top</a> 
									</div>
									<p class="lh25-new mt10">This depends on your data plan. The larger the data plan, the more domestic data roaming you have access to each month. This also means that if you exceed the amount for your plan, you may be able to upgrade to a larger plan either temporarily or permanently. <a href="#">See chart</a> to determine the domestic data roaming allotment for your data plan.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<div class="mt30">Note: The megabyte allotment for your data plan can often be found by reviewing the
										<h5 class="p0 m0">Available Service Section</h5>
										on page 1 of your bill (ex: Classic Simple 200MB Data Promo) or by dialing
										<h5 class="p0 m0">#WEB# Send</h5>

										<a class="pull-right" href="#">top</a> 
									</div>
									<p class="lh25-new mt10">You will receive a free usage alert via text message to notify you once you use 80% of your monthly domestic data roaming allotment. You will receive another free usage alert via text message to notify you when you reach 100% of your domestic data roaming allotment. These text messages will contain a link that will allow you to view your real-time usage. You can also view your domestic data usage by using the MyAccount feature on your device while roaming.</p>

									</div>
									<p class="lh25-new mt10">You can upgrade your data plan to one that includes a higher domestic data roaming allotment (temporarily or permanently), return to the T-Mobile network, wait for your billing cycle to start over, or use Wi-Fi for unlimited data access if you have a Wi-Fi capable device once you reach your domestic data roaming limit.</p>

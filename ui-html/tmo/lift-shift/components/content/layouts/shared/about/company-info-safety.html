									<h5 class="color-gray-dark mb20 ">Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA)</h5>
									<p class="mb30 lh25-new">WEA is a new public safety system that enables authorized agencies to send text-like messages to consumers with capable wireless devices to alert them of emergencies in their area.</p>
									<p class="mb30">Through the use of cell towers, WEA allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to deliver emergency warnings to specific geographic regions. After receiving a warning, local cell towers broadcast a wireless alert to a dedicated receiver within alert-capable devices in the area.</p>
									<h6 class="mb20 text-bolder">NOTICE REGARDING TRANSMISSION OF WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERTS <br>
								(Wireless Emergency Alerts)</h6>
									<p class="lh25-new">T-Mobile has chosen to offer WEA wireless emergency alerts on capable devices throughout <a href="/coverage/pcc.aspx" title="">the T-Mobile coverage areas</a>, as defined by the terms and conditions of our service agreement.</p>
									<p class="mb30 lh25-new">There is no additional charge for these emergency alerts. Alerts may not be available: on certain devices; if a subscriber is outside the T-Mobile coverage area; or due to interference concerns.</p>
									<p class="mb30 lh25-new">Review our list of <a href="/cell-phones.wea-capable.html" title="">alert-capable devices</a> or ask a sales representative for more information.</p>
									<p class="mb30 lh25-new">Notice required by FCC Rule 47 C.F. R. § 10.240, § 10.250 (Wireless Emergency Alerts).</p>
									<div id="faq">
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: What types of alerts will WEA deliver?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> WEA alerts the public about critical emergencies such as wildfires and hurricanes, major highway accidents, university campus lockdowns, and child abductions. Alerts are issued by the National Weather Service, state and local authorities, and the president of the United States. There are three specific types.</p>
										<ol class="pl20">
											<li class="ml20">Presidential Alerts</li>
											<li class="ml20">Imminent Threats to Life and Property Alerts</li>
											<li class="ml20">AMBER Alerts</li>
										</ol>
										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: Who will receive WEA alerts?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> Alerts are geographically targeted, so only customers currently in the threat area will receive them. For example: If an alert is sent in New York , a customer with a capable device who lives in that area will not receive the alert if they are in Chicago at the time the alert is sent. Similarly, someone with a capable device visiting New York from Chicago when the alert is sent would receive the alert.</p>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: Do I need GPS for alerts to work?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> No. Alerts are not delivered to specific phones, so WEA does not need to identify your phone’s location. Rather, an alert is broadcast to a specific area. Any capable device on the T-Mobile network located in that area will receive the alert.</p>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: What if I travel into an affected area after an alert is sent?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> Alerts will be sent every 5 minutes until the alert expires. So, if you travel into an affected area after the original alert is sent, you will receive a subsequent alert (unless the alert is expired). Your device will only display the alert once.</p>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: Are WEA alerts free?</h5>
										<div class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> Yes. Customers do not pay to receive WEA alerts.</div>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: Do I have to sign up to receive alerts?</h5>
										<div class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> No. T-Mobile customers with capable devices are automatically signed up for WEA.</div>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: Can I block WEA alerts?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> Partially. You can block alerts involving imminent threats to safety and/or AMBER Alerts; but, you cannot block emergency alerts issued by the president. See the user manual for your device for instructions or review general <a href="http://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-3031" title="">blocking instructions.</a>
										</p>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: What will happen when I receive a WEA alert?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> WEA alerts appear much like a text message and are accompanied by a unique audible signal and vibration. Alerts will be short, easy to read, and contain basic information.</p>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: What devices are capable of receiving WEA alerts?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> In most cases, you will need to purchase a new alert-capable handset is you wish to receive alerts. See the list of T-Mobile’s <a href="/cell-phones.wea-capable.html" title="">alert-capable devices</a>. Over time, we will continue to add models to this list. A limited number of T-Mobile devices will just require a software upgrade to become alert-capable.</p>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: Can I receive WEA alerts if I have a prepaid phone?</h5>
										<div class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> Yes. You can receive alerts on a prepaid phone as long as your device is alert-capable.</div>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: Why did the government start WEA?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> WEA is designed to supplement the existing Emergency Alert System which announces public safety alerts through broadcasters and other media service providers. The system was implemented by the FCC in response to the Warning, Alert and Response Act passed by Congress in 2006.</p>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: Does the WEA program have other names?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> Some agencies and carriers may refer to WEA as the “Personal Localized Alerting Network” (or PLAN). Others may call WEA the “Commercial Mobile Alert System” (or CMAS). These names all refer to the WEA public safety system.</p>
										<h5 class="text-bolder color-gray-dark mb20">Q: How can I learn more about WEA?</h5>
										<p class="mb20 lh25-new"><span class="text-bold">A:</span> For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/personal-localized-alerting-network-plan" title="">FCC website.</a>

								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>Public Safety / 9-1-1</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">T-Mobile USA is committed to a partnership with Public Safety to provide the best possible 9-1-1 service for our subscribers and roaming customers in times of emergency.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>What is Basic 9-1-1 service?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">Basic 9-1-1 service is an emergency telephone system which automatically connects wireless 9-1-1 calls to a designated 9-1-1 Communications Center. Basic 9-1-1 may or may not provide the wireless phone’s 10-digit call-back number and estimated location. The handset must have battery power and be in a coverage area to complete a 9-1-1 call.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>What is Enhanced 9-1-1 Phase I service?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">Enhanced 9-1-1 Phase I service is the first step in providing better emergency response service to wireless 9-1-1 callers. Public Safety/9-1-1 Communications Centers need to send a letter to T-Mobile requesting Phase I service deployment at their agency. Once Phase I service has been implemented, when a wireless 9-1-1 call comes into the 9-1-1 Communications Center (also called a Public Safety Answering Point or PSAP), the call-taker's computer screen will show the wireless phone's 10-digit call-back number if one has been assigned to the calling handset. In the event the wireless phone call is dropped, the call-taker may contact the caller. Phase I service also identifies the cell site/sector location information that the call was originated on to the call-taker's computer screen. This provides the call-taker with a general location (i.e. within the site coverage area) of the caller. The handset must have battery power and be in a coverage area to complete a 9-1-1 call.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>What is Enhanced 9-1-1 Phase II service?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">Public Safety/9-1-1 Communications Centers need to send a letter to T-Mobile requesting Phase II service deployment at their agency. With Phase II service, the location information that is provided to the 9-1-1 Communications Center is the approximate X, Y (longitude, latitude) location of the handset making the 9-1-1 call. This location information is typically more accurate than the Phase I location information (cell site/sector). As with Phase I, Phase II service allows call-takers to receive both the caller's wireless phone number and their estimated location information. Since early 2004, T-Mobile has been deploying Phase II services. T-Mobile utilizes a hybrid solution, referred to as U-TDOA, Uplink-Time Difference of Arrival and AGPS, Assisted Global Positioning System, to provide an estimated Phase II location to the 9-1-1 Communications Center. The handset must have battery power and be in a coverage area to complete a 9-1-1 call.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>What is Text to 9-1-1 service?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">Placing a voice call to 9-1-1 is your best option during an emergency. At this time, some 9-1-1 Centers are able to receive and/or respond to text messages sent to 9-1-1 via a T-Mobile handset. If a customer attempts to send a text to 9-1-1 in an area where the service is not available, an auto-reply message will be sent to the handset stating:
										<br/>
										<strong class="text-black">“Please make a voice call to 911. There is no text service to 911 available at this time in this area. This is a free message.”</strong>
										<br/>T-Mobile entered into a voluntary agreement to begin the deployment of Text to 9-1-1 service starting in mid-2014. Public Safety/9-1-1 Communications Centers will need to send a letter to T-Mobile requesting Text to 9-1-1 service deployment at their agency once they are ready to receive text messaging. Please note, making a voice call to 9-1-1 is still the most efficient way to contact emergency services.</p>

									<h5>T-Mobile's public education efforts</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">T-Mobile is committed to educating our customers about mobile phones and 9-1-1. On T-Mobile.com and in materials sent directly to customers we also address issues such as accidental calls to 9-1-1. The State of Washington's 9-1-1 Office created these brochures:</p>
									<ul class="mt20 p0 list-unstyled">
										<li><a href="#">Accidental 9-1-1 calls</a>
										</li>
										<li><a href="#">9-1-1 llamadas accidentales</a>
										</li>
										<li><a href="#">What's Your Location </a>
										</li>
									</ul>
									<div>
										<h5 class="mt30 mb10 text-normal color-gray-dark">Remember…when calling 9-1-1 during an emergency:</h5>
										<ul class="mt20 pl20 list-style-disc lh25-new">
											<li>Stay calm and speak clearly.</li>
											<li>Do not hang up until the 9-1-1 call taker has obtained all of the information that is needed.</li>
											<li>Since you are calling from a wireless phone, your call may be disconnected if the signal is lost. Be sure to call 9-1-1 back if you are cut off. If you are driving, consider pulling off the road and stopping the vehicle to complete the 9-1-1 call.</li>
											<li>Your 9-1-1 call may need to be transferred to another agency.</li>

								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>As a T-Mobile subscriber, do I need to sign up for Phase I and II service?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">No. The Public Safety/9-1-1 Communications Center serving a particular area requests the service from T-Mobile, not the subscriber. Once the service is requested by the 9-1-1 Communications Center and deployed by T-Mobile, it is provided for all the T-Mobile network users in that area. T-Mobile has deployed Enhanced 9-1-1 Phase I and Phase II service throughout much of the country.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>How do I know whether Phase I or Phase II services have been deployed in a particular area where I’m making wireless calls?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">Because there are over 6,100 9-1-1 Communications Centers in the United States, we suggest you contact the 9-1-1 Center in your area by calling their non-emergency/administrative phone number (usually found near the front of the local phone book or directory) to determine that agency's ability to receive wireless Enhanced 9-1-1 calls.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>Once a Public Safety/9-1-1 Communication Center requests Phase I and II service from T-Mobile, how long does it take to have the service available?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">The Federal Communications Commission has mandated wireless carriers to deploy Phase I and II services within 6 months of a request from the Public Safety/9-1-1 Communications Center. Occasionally, this timeline is adjusted per mutual agreement.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>Do I need to purchase an upgraded handset in order for Phase I and II services to work?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">No. T-Mobile’s Phase II solution does not require subscribers upgrade or change their handset. The level of service is the same regardless of whether you are a postpaid, Monthly4G or prepaid subscriber. Note for Monthly4G and prepaid subscribers: If your call to 9-1-1 is disconnected for some reason and there is a need for the 9-1-1 Communications Center to call you back, you will need to have minutes available on your account for the return call to be completed.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>What happens when I call 9-1-1 from my wireless phone?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">The T-Mobile network will route your 9-1-1 call to the designated 9-1-1 Communications Center (also called a Public Safety Answering Point or PSAP). When your call is answered by the 9-1-1 dispatcher, be ready to answer questions such as: 1. Where is the emergency? Provide highway name, direction of travel, mile marker, intersection, etc. 2. What number are you calling from? Always give your area code and wireless phone number. 3. What exactly has happened? Clearly describe what has taken place.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>I have T-Mobile prepaid service, can I still reach 9-1-1?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">Yes. All T-Mobile handsets can process 9-1-1 calls, regardless if you are a Monthly4G or prepaid subscriber, or a contract subscriber. The phone must have battery power and be in a coverage area to complete a 9-1-1 call. If your call to 9-1-1 is disconnected for some reason and there is a need for the 9-1-1 Communications Center to call you back, you will need to have minutes available on your account for the return call to be completed.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>I kept my phone number from a different state when I moved. When I dial 9-1-1 from my T-Mobile handset, will my call be routed to the closest 9-1-1 center?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">Yes. The T-Mobile network will route your 9-1-1 call to the designated 9-1-1 Communications Center, regardless of the 10-digit phone number assigned to the phone. Be sure to provide your area code with your phone number to the 9-1-1 dispatcher.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>What should I do if I accidentally dial 9-1-1?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">You should stay on the line until the 9-1-1 dispatcher has answered the call and indicate the call was made by mistake and no emergency assistance is needed.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>If I have subscribed to WiFi Calling service, do I need to register the location of my device for 9-1-1 purposes?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">Yes. You will be asked to supply a street address at which the WiFi Calling service will be used. The registered location you provide may be used to help emergency responders locate you after you complete a 9-1-1 call using this service. This location information should be updated if you use this service at a different location. Your location information can be provided and/or updated by accessing your account at MyT-Mobile.com or by contacting T-Mobile Customer Care.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>What level of 9-1-1 service will I receive using WiFi Calling service?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">When you make a 9-1-1 call with a WiFi Calling enabled phone, your phone will first attempt to complete the call like any other phone in the T-Mobile network. Depending on the capabilities of your local 9-1-1 Communications Center, you may receive Wireless Enhanced Phase I, Phase II, or Basic 9-1-1 service as described above. T-Mobile works very closely with the 9-1-1 Communication Centers to deploy the best possible 9-1-1 service supported by the 9-1-1 Communication Centers. If you are at your registered location (as described above) and wireless coverage is unavailable, your phone will try to complete the 9-1-1 call using special WiFi Calling functionality. Your location is one of a number of methods which may be used to route your 9-1-1 call and provide your location to the designated 9-1-1 Communications Center. Therefore, it is very important to keep the registered address information current. Your location information can be provided and/or updated by accessing your account at My T-Mobile or by contacting T-Mobile Customer Care.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>What level of 9-1-1 service will I receive using my WiFi Calling handset when I am away from my registered location?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">If you are accessing WiFi Calling service at a T-Mobile HotSpot and wireless coverage is unavailable, the 9-1-1 call will be routed to the designated 9-1-1 Communications Center serving that location. If you are using a WiFi Calling enabled phone via an access point other than the one associated with your existing registered location, it is important for you to update that information with your new address by accessing your account at My T-Mobile or by contacting T-Mobile Customer Care. When you return to your prior location, you will need to update your registered location again.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5>Is it necessary to test my handset/service by calling 9-1-1 when I do not have an emergency?</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">No. Please do not call 9-1-1 to simply test the system. T-Mobile works very closely with the 9-1-1 Communication Centers to deploy the best possible 9-1-1 service. Please be sure to register and update the location of your service as described above.</p>

									<p class="lh25-new">Wireless phones emit low levels of radio-frequency (RF) energy during use. Based on scientific data currently available, T-Mobile has not determined that RF energy from wireless phones causes health risks. Nonetheless, we want our customers to be informed as the wireless industry and government agencies continue to monitor the ongoing scientific research on this important subject.</p>

								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5 class="mt30 color-gray-dark">FCC Standards</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has established standards governing the RF energy emission levels for all wireless phones sold in the United States, as well as RF energy emissions from cellular towers, in order to protect the health of the general public.</p>
									<p class="lh25-new mt15">You may have heard the terms “SAR” or “SAR value.” “SAR” stands for Specific Absorption Rate, which is a measure of the rate of absorption of RF energy in the body. The FCC has established maximum SAR values for wireless phones in the United States. Since 1996, the FCC has set the maximum SAR value for handheld wireless phones at 1.6 watts per kilograms, averaged over one gram of tissue. A wireless phone model must be tested by the manufacturer and certified to the FCC to not exceed this limit before it may be made available to the public. Because the SAR value is determined using the phone’s highest power level, the actual SAR level of a phone while operating may be less than the reported SAR value. You can contact your phone’s manufacturer or refer to its user manual to learn more about its SAR value.</p>

									<h5 class="mt30 color-gray-dark">Scientific studies have not shown a conclusive relationship between wireless phone use and health problems.</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new">You may have heard reports that RF exposure from wireless phones presents a health risk. Global health organizations and government agencies have conducted scientific research on the potential health effects of RF exposure, and have determined that the available scientific evidence does not conclusively show a relationship between wireless phone use and health problems. The FCC’s website explains that, while research is ongoing, “[t]here is no scientific evidence that proves that wireless phone usage can lead to cancer or a variety of other problems, including headaches, dizziness or memory loss.”</p>
									<p class="lh25-new mt15 ml40">Following the World Health Organization’s (“WHO”) release of the largest study to date on cell phone use and brain tumors, the Interphone Study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commented that while research was ongoing, the “available scientific evidence – including the [Interphone Study]– shows no increased health risk due to radiofrequency (RF) energy.”</p>
									<p class="lh25-new mt15 ml40">The FDA also noted that a separate National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) program found that occurrences of brain cancer did not increase between 1987 and 2005, despite a dramatic increase in cell phone use during those years. The NCI’s bulletin explains that “[c]oncerns about the potential health effects of using cellular telephones . . . – and specifically the suggestion that using a cell phone may increase a person’s risk of developing brain cancer – are not supported by a growing body of research on the subject.”</p>

								<section class="mt20 mb35">
									<h5 class="mt30 ml20">The FDA has also reported on WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer</h5>
									<p class="lh25-new ml40">(IARC) classification for RF energy. IARC reviewed the medical literature regarding RF energy, and classified it in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans), which means there is limited evidence showing radiofrequency carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. For perspective on what this means, IARC has also classified, among other things, coffee, pickled vegetables, and talcum powder in Group 2B.</p>

									<p class="lh25-new">Driving tips—make safety your top priority T-Mobile encourages you to use your phone in a safe and sensible manner, especially while driving. Remember to avoid distractions; keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road. Some jurisdictions regulate phone use while driving. Familiarize yourself with your local regulations and always remember to obey the law.
										<br/>
										<br/>Here are some valuable tips for using your phone safely while on the road:</p>
									<ul class="list-style-disc lh25-new p0">
										<li>Make safe driving your top priority.</li>
										<li>Assess road conditions before making or taking a call—consider letting voicemail handle your calls and return them at your convenience.</li>
										<li>Use a hands-free device such as a portable headset.</li>
										<li>Place your phone within easy reach.</li>
										<li>Know your phone and its features, especially speed dial and redial. Program your most frequently dialed numbers into your phone or SIM card.</li>
										<li>Use the voice dial feature available on some phones. Do not take notes or look up phone numbers while driving.</li>
										<li>Dial sensibly—place calls when stopped or before pulling into traffic.</li>
										<li>Let the person you are speaking to know you are driving; if necessary, suspend the call—especially in heavy traffic or hazardous weather conditions.</li>
										<li>Do not engage in stressful or emotional conversations that may divert your attention from the road.</li>
										<li>911 is a free call from your phone. Use it for reporting reckless drivers, emergencies, or other potentially hazardous situations. Know your phone number so emergency personnel can call you back</li>
										<li>Have a teenage driver in your family? Educate them about the dangers of distracted driving and let them know: If they’re on the road, they need to stay off the phone. Learn more</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="lh25-new mt25">Note: Calls made in the coverage area, including 911 calls, may not always be completed due to factors such as: network changes, traffic volume, service outages, technical limitations, signal strength, your equipment, terrain, structures, weather, and other conditions that may interfere with actual service.</p>
